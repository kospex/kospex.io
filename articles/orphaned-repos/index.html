                    <em>TLDR:</em> If no one knows the code, how will you fix or
                    redeploy it? Knowledge of code is important to maintain,
                    operate and make bug or security fixes. However, removing
                    unused repos might improve focus by removing clutter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the book, The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks, it talks
                    about disproportionate amount of time developers spend
                    thinking compared to coding. Some say that that source code
                    is only 30% of the development process, with thinking,
                    discussions and discovery being the other 70%. So even if
                    we've got the code, we're missing the thinking which is
                    still in the developers head. Even documentation might not
                    do justice to that days or weeks of thinking and discussions
                    which occurred.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some of the "why we did this?" and "that failed so we did it
                    this way" will be missing when the next person comes along.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am pretty sure if you ask most developers, reading someone
                    else's code, and changing it, with little context is hard.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Seems like companies are experiencing between 15-25% churn
                    in their developers, either through voluntary "change of
                    scenery" or "resizing", which can cause working knowledge
                    gaps as well as orphaned repos.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>What is an orphaned repo?</em> <br />An orphaned repo
                    (Git code repository) is where no developers who've
                    contributed code work for your organisation. Maybe, is not
                    an issue if the repo is old and unused, so we can delete or
                    achive. However, there can still be challenges if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The code is in use - now we have an operational risk if
                        something goes wrong
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's old, maybe unused, but has secrets or passwords. Do
                        we archive? do we clean the secrets before archiving?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is there intellectual property we care about but might
                        not be using?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <em
                        >Why is this important? My other developers know
                        language X used in this repo?</em
                    >
                </p>

                <p>
                    Context is hard to transfer. Just like picking up a recipe
                    you've never cooked before, it's going to take more time
                    even if you can read the instructions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The knowledge domain could be different. Just because we can
                    read and write in a language, does not mean we can write a
                    legal contract in that language (unless we have that
                    expertise or experience).
                </p>

                <p>
                    A company I know who takes on maintenance of applications
                    for other companies said that it often takes a developer
                    around six weeks to be comfortable with the code to be able
                    to maintain and improve it from a cold start.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When something is broken and you need to patch a security

                <p><em>How to identify orphaned repos.</em></p>

                <p>
                    There a two methods of identifying orphaned repos, with
                    varied degrees of accuracy. Both methods requiring looking
                    at the commits or changes to a repository, but the source of
                    "who works here" is different. The method is simple, find
                    all the developers (typically email addresses) in a code
                    repository, see how many appear in our "active" developer or
                    employee list.

                        cross reference developer commit history in the repo

                    >
                </p>

                <p>
                    Compare people in a repo to an extract from HR or staff
                    directory, will give an accurate can be more accurate,
                    compared to the lack of activity method used above. The crux
                    of this method requires the extract or ability to query a
                    staff directory, then looking at the developers in each
                    repository and checking if they are in the extract.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em
                        >#2 Use version control history and see if developers in
                        a repo are still committing in other repositories</em
                    >
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some places use definitions of an active developer having
                    activity in say 30 or 90 days. Using this method we can stay
                    within git to check if users in a repo have been seen in
                    other repos and consider them "gone" if they haven't been
                    active in X days.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The key challenge with this method is that we're "guessing"
                    someone has left if they haven't committed and it takes a
                    while to consider them gone. So the feedback loop is much
                    better if you can query a HR extract or lookup a directory.

                    >
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sure can. Basically, if only one person (who is still here)
                    has worked on the code, then you have a single point of
                    failure risk. You might want to set a threshold of two or
                    three people who have worked on a repo if its important
                    enough to keep using. I've seen people purposefully making a
                    new person make changes and deploy (under guidance) to build
                    experience in the process, and reduce reliance on other
                    people.

                        >Are all developers the same? What about cross

                    >
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, while there is talk of "full stack" developers, from
                    what I've seen there's still a lot of Person X is the Front
                    end developer, and Person Y is the database person.
                    Depending on the complexity, similar to key person risk, you
                    may want to break down the types of code into skill sets or
                    capabilities. For example, you may have people who know the
                    front end code, but have zero working knowledge of the
                    database.

                <p>
                    Secrets seems to be a challenge for most organistaions,
                    everyone needs them and where do you put them (which should
                    NOT be code, but it happens). Secrets is a whole other
                    topic, but we have a few interesting cases in orphaned
                    repos. Just say you find secrets, there's a few things to
                    confirm:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Are they active and do we use them? (Also, have we had a
                        breach from a clone?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If they are active, we should probably roll or change
                        the credentials if still used
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Are they old and inactive (like old SSL keys an
                        certificates)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do we try to clean the repo before archiving? Or just
                        delete it?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><em>Do we archive or delete?</em></p>
                <p>
                    This question has quite a subjective response depending on
                    companies archiving and destruction processes to be
                    followed. One company I've worked with I thought had a good
                    approach:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Archive it (so still accessible) by moving location in
                        Git when criteria is met such as No commits in 1-2
                        years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        See if anyone asks for it in 12 months after it's
                        archived.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Figure out after 12 months if you need to retain in
                        archive for X years or can delete They were a big
                        company with thousands of developers, so this is an
                        ongoing process that needs to be run. Even in smaller
                        longer running teams, these rules probably still apply.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    From my security side, when you start working with an
                    organisation, their developers and code, there can be a lot
                    to take in. Often with hundreds to thousands of repos, you
                    ask, what's actually being used in production, and what's
                    old code. There's three parts to this focus:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product owner - what do I need to maintain?</li>
                    <li>Security - Is this code or application secure?</li>
                    <li>Developer - what am I working on?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Anecdotally, from discussions with Devolopment managers and
                    even security assurance, you want to know what's being used
                    and remove what's not needed. I think less clutter means
                    less wasted time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Keep in mind that developers change all the time, the
                    current vibe is 20-30% yearly churn. A new developer has to
                    come into an environment has to understand what's important,
                    so removing old unused orphaned repos I think helps. From an
                    application security or assurance point of view, remove the
                    noise to focus on the important stuff.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So far, we haven't talked about opensource libraries and
                    code in the software supply chain. There are simple ways of
                    just looking at library versions to see if they look
                    unmaintained or orphaned.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For opensource, I think it's safe to call something
                    unmaintained and probably orphaned if a library or repo you
                    use hasn't been updated in 12 month. I'd be worried without
                    seeing activity after three months.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We've talked about orphans and hinted about maintenance
                    status. Orphans is about having no people who know the code,
                    but aging or maintenance status is a different indicator
                    worth looking at. I'd suggest that looking at what hasn't
                    been maintained recently but still being used is good
                    activity to identify hotspots.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, asking for a friend, what are you doing about orphaned
                    repos?

                    This command works on the configurable active developers
